# Applied Cryptography





## Symmetric encryption
* One key for encryption and decryption
* Small block algorithm
* Chaining mode to encrypt/ decrypt lager blocks
* Properties are important



## Asymetric encryption

RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman 1977)

* Asymmetric: Private Key, Public Key
* Practical difficulty of factoring product of large primes
* RSA-2048 (means a 2048-bit (256 bytes) can be encrypted)
* Used for signing and key-exchange
* Based on Group Theory (x^Y^ mod n)
